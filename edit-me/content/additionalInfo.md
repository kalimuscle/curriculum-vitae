As a professional, I dedicate some of my free time to disseminating information on relevant topics in the world of finance and technology. I am passionate about sharing my knowledge on Bitcoin, Blockchain, and economics through courses that I teach. I believe in the importance of educating people on these topics, as I consider them to be key tools for the future.

Additionally, I also like to explore history and learn about the past. I am interested in understanding how past events have influenced our present and how we can apply this knowledge to make informed decisions in the future.

Finally, I like to stay physically active and enjoy playing soccer in my free time. I believe that maintaining a balance between work and personal life is key to achieving success in all areas of our life.
