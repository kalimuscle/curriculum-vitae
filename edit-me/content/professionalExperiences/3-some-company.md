As the creator of the NinjuCuba project, I had the opportunity to lead an exciting startup that connected software developers with people who needed their services. During my time at NinjuCuba, I played several roles, including project manager and full-stack developer. It was an enriching experience as I was able to apply my skills in different areas and learn firsthand what it takes to launch and grow a successful business.

As a project manager, I was responsible for coordinating and supervising the work of the development team. I worked closely with other team members to ensure that projects were delivered within the deadline and budget, while also ensuring that client requirements were met. As a full-stack developer, I was able to apply my skills in the front-end and back-end of the project to create a complete and effective solution.

One of NinjuCuba's biggest achievements was being selected as one of the top 10 technological startups in the country. This recognition was proof of our success and motivated us to continue working hard to improve and expand our services. It was a great honor for us to be recognized for our work and it drove us forward in our goals.

During my time at NinjuCuba, I learned the importance of innovation and creativity in the business world. As a startup, we had to constantly be creative and think outside the box to find effective and scalable solutions. I also learned the importance of collaboration and teamwork, as we worked together to build a platform that was easy to use and accessiblefor all users.[link1](https://www.ipscuba.net/sin-categoria/ninjacuba-la-red-social-de-los-emprendimientos-cubanos/), [link2](https://panamericanworld.com/revista/startups/ninjacuba-comunidad-freelnacer-cubana-emprendimiento-empleadores/) [deploy](https://d1vd6uz0nzikck.cloudfront.net/)
