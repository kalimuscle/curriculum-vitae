For a period of time, I dedicated myself to training in blockchain technology. During this time, I had the opportunity to learn about public and private blockchains, smart contract development in Solidity, working with Decentralized Finance (DEFI), distributed technologies, token economics, and much more.

My main focus was on learning about smart contract development in Solidity, which allowed me to apply my programming skills in a blockchain environment. I learned how to design and create smart contracts that met the specific requirements of the application and how to implement them on a variety of blockchain platforms.

I also learned about Decentralized Finance (DEFI) and how blockchain technology is enabling new forms of online financial exchange. I learned about the various DEFI platforms and how they are being used for the creation of new financial products such as loans, exchanges, and more. Additionally, I learned about token economics and how tokens are being used to create more efficient and fair economic systems.
