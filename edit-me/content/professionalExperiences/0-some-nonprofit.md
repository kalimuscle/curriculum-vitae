My experience as an intern at GeoCuba provided me with a valuable opportunity to learn and grow as a software developer. I learned how to work in a dynamic team and apply my knowledge in the development of effective and realistic solutions. In addition, I learned to work with technologies such as OpenGL and Unreal Engine, which allowed me to expand my skill set and be better prepared for future challenges.
