I was in charge of bringing simulated systems to the web. This was an exciting challenge as it involved creating a web interface that would allow users to interact with simulation systems effectively. As a full-stack developer, I was able to apply my skills in front-end and back-end development to create an efficient and effective solution that would allow users to interact with simulated systems from anywhere.

Later, I developed a system that enabled metrological management and control. This system was created to help users make accurate and reliable measurements through an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. As a full-stack developer, I was able to apply my skills in database and back-end development to ensure that data was stored effectively and securely, while the user interface remained easy to use and accessible.

Finally, I developed a system for the study of cadastral systems. This project was particularly exciting as it involved creating a system that would allow users to conduct detailed studies of cadastral systems. As a full-stack developer, I was able to apply my skills in front-end and back-end development to create an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that would allow users to access information quickly and effectively.
