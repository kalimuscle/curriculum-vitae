As a member of the team that developed the cryptocurrency payment platform for Aeroenv√≠o, I was able to apply my skills in web application development using technologies such as Angular and Python. I was responsible for creating the user interface and logic behind the payment platform, ensuring that it was secure, reliable, and efficient. I learned the importance of collaboration and effective communication in a development team, as well as the need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field. Additionally, this experience allowed me to learn more about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and how they are changing the way online financial transactions are conducted.[link](https://www.aeroenvio.com/)
