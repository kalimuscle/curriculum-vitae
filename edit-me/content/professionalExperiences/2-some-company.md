My main role as a developer was to work on the front-end of applications using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Silverlight. During my time in this position, I had the opportunity to develop solutions for European clients, which allowed me to apply my skills in a fast-paced and multicultural environment.
